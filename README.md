 Protocols to be FOLLOWED by every JSON Updater 

1. Any news not falling under Wallpapers, Icon Packs, Widgets, KLWP category will go to TOP NEWS section and if the promo pic is good that can go in the HIGHLIGHTS section

i.e., KWGT Updates (the app itself), Launcher Updates, BitLit Updates will go into TOP NEWS category

(since they don't fall under any other categories)



2. Highlights section need to be Updated every 2 days (just copy and paste the news that are HIGHLIGHTS section worthy)

Contents for HIGHLIGHTS section :
i. App SALEs
ii. Giveaways
iii. New Launches

(p.s. any news going to HIGHLIGHTS section must have a good promo image)



3. Top News section has to be Updated with every Update

example....if you're adding 4 news to Wallpapers Category, copy paste 1 of them (most important one) to TOP News Section


4. Add PlayStore Link instead of Twitter Links for SALEs & Updates (except of Wallpapers)


5. Single wallpaper won't count as news (that mean the wallpapers released for only one times in a small quantity; precisely 1-2, won't be added in Bitlit)

6. Don't add shortened link in URL section, even if its provided directy from dev.
   First fully open the link, copy it and paste it in URL section.

7. use tags like these at the front of the title
[FREE], [SALE], [GIVEAWAY]
